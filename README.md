# kaggle-competition
This repository consist of my kaggle competitions
this is a data from kaggle competition which contains data of the survivors in the TITANIC. Here it consist of some features namely the passenger ID, name, sex, class, embarked, and some more informations, these are the labels. There is one more column which indicates if the passenger survived or died in the incident. 
So here we have to train the model from the training data and have to test it on the test data. then we have to see the accuracy. so in this code i have used RAndomForesClassifier model to train the model. 
once the training is done, the test data is been put in the model and checked for the accuracy. then the output is been saved and submitted to the server.
